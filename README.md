## **3. Distraction Tracker:**
This is a simple app that helps you to track how oftenly you distract from your work/study. You can also store the number of times you have distracted in the previous time and then compare with current time, thus improve your performance. Another feature is, it will alert you if you get distracted more oftenly.
